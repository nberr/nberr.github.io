      <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
            Welcome to my webpage! You can call me Nico. I'm a programmer with a BS
            in Computer Science and an MSc in Digital Signal Processing (DSP). I'm always looking
            to improve my abilities as a programmer and help other people refine their
            processes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After undergrad I was working odd jobs and discovered the world of audio programming.
            I've played piano for 20 years and have always been passionate about music. After
            taking an online course for audio programming, I was eager to learn more which led
            to my pursuit for a MSc in DSP.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Although my interest mainly lies in the audio domain, I'm happy to help
            others refine their processes in other areas. Take a look below to see some
            projects I've worked on. Additionally, take a look at my personal projects
            and don't hesitate to reach out!

      <h2>Work</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Level Up Subs</h3>
            <div>
                Level Up Subs is a dealer for PSA grading. Their goal was to allow
                their customers to view the grading process as well as the grades from
                PSA's website. PSA doesn't offer a robust API to get this information so
                I was tasked with figuring out a work around.

            <h3>Minimal Audio</h3>
            <div>
                I worked for a company called Minimal Audio on a MIDI engine for
                an unreleased synthesizer plugin. This was my first time working
                with other developers and I learned a lot. It took a while to
                learn the codebase and adjust to working with others but I'm grateful
                for the opportunity to work with such an awesome team. I love their products
                and I'm excited to see my code in production.

            <h3>Bubbie Was Chubbie</h3>
            <div>
                A fitness coach reached out to me to create a desktop application that
                was able to take user input and generate a PDF based on the input. I worked
                closely with the client to make sure in understood the necessary calculations
                that the program would do to create a fitness goal for his clients.

            <h3>Everybody Edits TAS client</h3>
            <div>
                Everybody Edits was an online platformer Flash game. The game is currently
                dead due to Flash support ending. However, their is a small community that
                still plays the game with an offline client. I was approached by an individual
                to create a Tool Assisted Speedrun (TAS) client for the offline version.

                        a JUCE plugin. I was able to reverse engineer the patch
                        and create the plugin. This was done pre RNBO release so
                        I wasn't able to "export" the code from Max/MSP.
